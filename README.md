This repo does a from-scratch PyTorch implementation of Gemma3 270M model with simple stories dataset. It does not use pretrained weights, every stage from tokenizer to inference is built and run end-to-end. The final model generates simple, easy-to-understand stories for kids. 


## Architecture

![architecture](./architecture/architecture.png)

Source: https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/blob/main/ch05/12_gemma3

## Overview

- **270M total parameters**: 170M embedding parameters + 100M transformer parameters
- **Mixed attention patterns**: Combination of sliding window and full attention layers  
- **Efficient architecture**: Optimized for low power consumption and on-device deployment
- **Strong instruction following**: Pre-trained with robust instruction-following capabilities
- **Large-scale training**: Official Gemma3 270M was trained on 6 trillion tokens

**Note**: This implementation uses GPT-2 tokenizer (50K vocabulary) instead of the official Gemma3 270M tokenizer (256K vocabulary) for several practical reasons:

- **Tokenization Speed**: GPT-2 tokenizer is ~10x faster for large-scale tokenization due to its smaller vocabulary
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduces embedding layer from ~170M to ~32M parameters, making training feasible on consumer GPUs  
- **Training Time**: Faster softmax computation during training and inference due to smaller vocabulary
- **Dataset Compatibility**: TinyStories is English-only, so GPT-2's 50K vocabulary is sufficient for this use case
- **Preprocessing Speed**: Large dataset tokenization takes minutes instead of hours

This trade-off prioritizes training efficiency and accessibility while maintaining strong performance on English text tasks.

## Architecture Details

### Model Configuration
- **Vocabulary Size**: 50_257 tokens (GPT-2 tokenizer)
- **Context Length**: 32_768 tokens
- **Embedding Dimension**: 640
- **Number of Layers**: 18
- **Attention Heads**: 4
- **Hidden Dimension**: 2048
- **Head Dimension**: 256

### Key Features
1. **Grouped Query Attention (GQA) - technically Multi Query Attention**: Efficient attention mechanism with configurable key-value groups
2. **RoPE (Rotary Position Embeddings)**: Dual RoPE bases for local (10_000) and global (1_000_000) context
3. **Sliding Window Attention**: 512-token sliding window for efficient local context processing
4. **Mixed Layer Types**: Strategic placement of full attention layers (layers 6, 12, 18) among sliding attention layers
5. **RMS Normalization**: Root Mean Square normalization with Gemma3-style (1 + weight) scaling
6. **GELU Activation**: GELU activation function in feedforward blocks

## Training Details

### Dataset
- **TinyStories**: A dataset of simple stories for training small language models
- Tokenized using GPT-2 tokenizer instead of Gemma3's native tokenizer because:
  - GPT-2 tokenizer is ~10x faster for large-scale tokenization
  - TinyStories is English-only, so GPT-2's 50K vocabulary is sufficient  
  - Reduces model size and training time compared to Gemma3's 256K vocabulary
  - Official Gemma3 270M was trained on 6 trillion tokens from diverse multilingual sources
- Processed into memory-mapped binary files for efficient loading

### Training Configuration
- **Learning Rate**: 1e-4 with cosine annealing
- **Warmup Steps**: 1,000
- **Max Iterations**: 150,000
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Block Size**: 128 tokens
- **Gradient Accumulation**: 32 steps
- **Mixed Precision**: bfloat16
- **Optimizer**: AdamW with β₁=0.9, β₂=0.95, weight decay=0.1

### Training Features
- Weights & Biases integration for experiment tracking
- Gradient clipping (max norm 0.5)
- Best model checkpointing based on validation loss
- Mixed precision training with automatic scaling

## Usage

### Data Preparation
```python
python 01_data_preparation.py
```
This downloads the TinyStories dataset and preprocesses it into binary format.

### Training
```python
python 02_pre_training.py
```
Trains the model with W&B logging. Requires W&B account and login.

### Inference
